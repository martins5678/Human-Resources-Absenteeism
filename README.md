## Introduction
![Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martins5678/Human-Resources-Absenteeism/main/img/banner.jpg)

Company X  observed a significant drop in performance, and a deep inquiry into the cause revealed absenteeism is quite a problem. This has disrupted the companyâ€™s workflow and productivity, leading to delays in project completion and compromised customer service. Additionally, the incident has significantly burdened coworkers who had to compensate for the missing team members, potentially causing burnout and decreased morale. The management wants to make a data-driven decision to know how to help those victims of chronic absenteeism. 
By analyzing the human resources dataset, we discovered that health conditions that are more likely due to unhealthy lifestyles are quite common. We communicated the insights and made recommendations to the management to reduce the menace before it put an end to the company's existence.



## Goal of the Project

> Our task is to unearth insights into the causes of absenteeism using the human resources dataset, design a user-friendly power BI dashboard for the management to make quick data-driven insights, and provide recommendations to address the issue. 

   

## Skills and Tools Used

* Power BI
* DAX
* Project Management: Trello Board
* Data manipulation and visualization 
* Collaboration 
* Leadership


## Task Overview (My Contributions)

Here is a concise high-level review of the critical tasks to achieve the project goal.
* Gathered data from different sources, including SQL database and CSV text file, loading it to Power BI
* In-depth data exploration and manipulation to identify contributing features and solve data quality and structural issues such as missing values, duplicated values and outliers.
* Used DAX to create custom calculations and aggregations such as body mass index (BMI), months, season, etc, to investigate their impact on absenteeism.
* Designed an interactive dashboard for the management to make quick and data-driven decision
* Presented the insights and recommendations to technical and non-technical audiences.



## Outcome

We came up with the interactive dashboard shown below. The dashboard has two views: project overview and dashboard view, with an easy-to-use navigation bar to toggle between the pages. The dashboard can be filtered to a granular level using the apply filter button. Filters are hidden by default and become visible when clicking the apply filter button.

## Insights

Below are some valuable insights from the analysis:
* Nearly all the employees (33 out of 37) have been absent at least once due to medical reasons.
* Out of the total number of absenteeism recorded (639), medical reason accounts for 87% (555) of the reason for being absent.
* Of the 555 numbers of absenteeism from 33 employees due to medical reasons, 12 who are overweight or obese account for 272 (49%).
* Most of the 12 employees with the highest number of absenteeism due to medical reasons are either smokers, drinkers or both. And they are absent from work mainly on Monday, suggesting a social weekend.
*	The second most common reason for absenteeism (34 cases from 21 employees) is incomplete submission. 19 of the 21 employees in this category did not adhere to previous disciplinary measures, suggesting weak disciplinary action from the company. 
*	Employees who cited family-related reasons for absenteeism (11 out of 20) have neither a pet nor a child. This may imply a weak disciplinary measure.
*	11 employees have been absent 30 times without any justified reasons. This may imply weak disciplinary measures.



## Recommendations

Following the comprehensive analysis above, here are our recommendations. The management of company X should: 
*	Strengthen their discipline as employees use weak discipline to run away from work. This will reduce absenteeism by more than 20%.
*	Design a health campaign to enlighten employees about the health benefits of maintaining a good weight. This may cut off medical-related reasons by more than 30%.
*	Educate employees about the harm of smoking and drinking excessive alcohol and give support to people who want to quit.
*	 Give incentives and encouragement to the employees that do their work diligently. This will bring fulfilment and deepen employees' interest in the work.
